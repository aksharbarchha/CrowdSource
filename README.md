## What is CrowdSource ?

CrowdSource is an app developed to collect and store images of leaves of both diseased and healthy crops to create a dataset for future use.

Currently, CrowdSource is available only in Hindi.  We are currently working on providing multilingual support.

To store images in a central database, we have used [Zapier] to integrate Firebase Storage and Google Drive.
